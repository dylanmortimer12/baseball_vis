            <h2>Pre 1900's</h2>
            <p>The first National League game ever played was in <span class="Years" data="1876">1876</span>. With constantly changing rules,
            the run scoring environment of this era fluctuates wildly compared to the following eras.</p>
            <p>For example, an umpire crew was not formally required until <span class="Years" data="1879">1879</span>. In <span class="Years" data="1880">1880</span>, only 8 balls
            were in an at-bat were necessary for a walk. Four years later, in <span class="Years" data="1884">1884</span>, only 6 balls; It was
            not until <span class="Years" data="1889">1889</span> that 4 balls became the standard.</p>
            <p>Select <span class="btn Walks">Walks</span> to see walks per game increase
            fairly steadily through this time.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the distance of the mound to home plate was increased from 50 ft to 60 ft and 6 inches in <span class="Years" data="1893">1893</span>,
            significantly changing the difficulty of hitting.</p>
            <p>Select <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> per game or
            <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span> per game to see these increase through
            the pre-1900's era.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Dead Ball Era</h2>
            <p>In the Dead Ball Era we see overall scoring decrease from the Pre-1900's era when we look at
            <span class="btn RunsPerGame">Runs Per Game</span>. </p>
            <p>Homeruns initially decreased in the transition to the Dead Ball Era. The name 'Dead Ball Era' explains these
            depressions in run scoring and homeruns, as the quality and material of the baseball had a lot to do with the
            amount of runs scored at this time.</p>
            <p>Until <span class="Years" data="1911">1911</span>, the baseball had
            a soft rubber core, compared to the more kinetic cork-cored model that replaced it. Games would also be played
            with the same ball until it was unusable. Nowadays the one game will use upwards of 50 brand new balls.</p>
            <p>According to "The Strikeout Ascendant", the foul strike rule, adopted in <span class="Years" data="1901">1901</span> and <span class="Years" data="1903">1903</span> for the National and American Leagues
            respectively, was a huge contributor to the run suppression of the Dead Ball Era. The Foul Strike Rule is
            what made foul balls actually count as strikes, making hitting significantly more difficult.</p>
            <p>Another important
            consideration regarding the difficulty of hitting is that pitches involving foreign substances eg. the spitball were
            legal. Unsurprisingly <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> per game increases from the Pre-1900's Era until an unexplained late dip before
            the Live Ball Era.</p>
            </head>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Live Ball Era</h2>
            <p>
            The Live Ball Era began with any doctoring of the ball, eg. spitballs, being outlawed and with the replacement of dirty or scuffed balls during the game.
            The later change was enacted largely in reaction to Ray Chapman's death, who was hit in the head with a scuffed baseball that got away from the pitcher.
            The ball also became arguably harder and more kinetic when new yarn began to be used in its manufacturing.</p>
            <p>Select <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> to see a decline in the strikeout rate from the Deadball Era
            into the Live Ball Era, thanks to balls having more predictable movement due to these changes.</p>
            <p>We also see a clear increase in <span class="btn RunsPerGame">Runs Per Game</span> from the Dead Ball Era, with
            teams sometimes scoring over 5 runs a game after scoring fewer than three over the course of certain years previous.
            Additonally, an enormous jump in <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span> occured between the Dead Ball era into
            the Live Ball Era. The average homerun rate more than doubled from <span class="Years" data="1918">1918</span> to
            <span class="Years" data="1922">1922</span>.</p>
            <p>Also within the Live Ball Era was an isolated impact on the game due to many good players fighting in WWII.
            Runs and Homeruns sharply declined from <span class="Years" data="1940">1940</span> to <span class="Years" data="1943">1943</span> as a result.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Integration Era</h2>
            <p>On April 15th, <span class="Years" data="1947">1947</span>, Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's Color Barrier.
            Robinson debuted with the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers
            and won Rookie of the Year. Only months later, Larry Doby became the first black player to play in the American League
            with the Cleveland Indians. These two pioneers, among others, sparked baseball's integration era.</p>
            <p>The integration era was
            a time of fundamental change in baseball. If we look at <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span>, we can see that homerun production exploded.
            Hitters started hitting with significantly more power, as the average homerun rate climbed to .84% in <span class="Years" data="1950">1950</span>,
            shattering the previous high from <span class="Years" data="1940">1940</span> at .64%. The average homerun rate climbed even higher to .95% by the
            end of the Integration Era in <span class="Years" data="1961">1961</span>.</p> <p>At the same time,
            we see <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> climbed at a similar pace. </p>
            <p>It's clear that hitters' approaches were changing; They became less contact/slap oriented
            and more geared towards swinging for the fences. The approach was high risk/high reward, reflected in these increases in homeruns and
            strikeouts.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Expansion Era</h2>
            <p>The Expansion Era begins in the <span class="Years" data="1961">60's</span>, characterized by an increasing number of teams.
            At this time, the American League added two new teams: the Los Angeles Angels and the Washington Senators.
            The new Senators team replaced a former Washington Senators team that moved to Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins. The
            National League also added teams now known as the Houston Astros and the New York Mets.</p>
            <p>We see that <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> increased initially in the Expansion Era,
            before regressing closer to the levels at the end of the Integration Era. We also see <span class="btn RunsPerGame">Runs Per Game</span>,
            <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span>, and <span class="btn Walks">Walks</span> decrease noisily from
            Integration Era levels in the Expansion Era.</p>
            <p>These trends can be explained by an increase in the size of the strike zone in <span class="Years" data="1963">1963</span>. The
            strike zone was not returned to its previous size until <span class="Years" data="1969">1969</span>.
            The height of the pitcher's mound was also lowered by 5 inches in <span class="Years" data="1969">1969</span>.</p>
            <p>Each of these rule changes significantly decreased pitchers' advantages over hitters. This is reflected in average strikeouts per game
            fairly steadily decreasing through the rest of the Expansion Era. We also see a sharp increase in homeruns from
            <span class="Years" data="1969">1969</span> to <span class="Years" data="1970">1970</span>.
            Walks increased in <span class="Years" data="1969">1969</span>, likely due in large part to the tighter strikezone.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Free Agent Era</h2>
            <p>The Free Agent Era is unsurprisingly named so because in <span class="Years" data="1976">1976</span>, MLB owners agreed to let players become free agents on the conditions that
            they had played out their contracts and had at least 6 years of service time. This was a fundamental change in the ways rosters were
            constructed and teams built. Yet regardless of the introduction of Free Agency, the changes on the graph are
            likely driven mostly by other factors. According to Steve Treder's article, many new stadiums built around the time of the Free Agent Era
            were built with astroturf, rather than real grass, in the outfield. Additionally, outfields were being built with increased dimensions.</p>
            <p>With bigger outfields and faster (fake) grass, teams tended to play smaller, quicker players rather than their larger power hitters. This explains an initial
            dip in <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span> as well as <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span>,
            given these smaller players were less likely to sell out for the long ball and strike out a lot.</p>
            <p>Yet by the <span class="Years" data="1980">1980's</span>, teams had almost universally ditched astroturf and returned to natural grass. This change lead to the return of
            power hitters. The results, as we can see, were jumps in homeruns and strikeouts as the <span class="Years" data="1970">1970's</span> turned into the
            <span class="Years" data="1980">1980's</span>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Steriod Era</h2>
            <p>The Steriod Era speaks for itself. <span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span> skyrocketed to all time highs as hitters became more power/strength oriented than
            ever, sometimes supplementing their training with performance enhancing drugs. Along with homeruns, <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> also
            reached all time highs as hitters focused on homeruns. <span class="btn RunsPerGame">Runs Per Game</span> was also at its highest rate since the height of
            the Live Ball Era.</p>
            <p>The Steriod Era will always be considered an era of shame for the game of baseball, yet also an era of incredible excitement.
            In <span class="Years" data="1998">1998</span>, Mark McGwire shattered Roger Maris' single season homerun record of 61, hitting 70 for the St. Louis Cardinals. Only three years later,
            Barry Bonds infamously broke McGwire's record, hitting 73 long balls in <span class="Years" data="2001">2001</span> for the San Francisco Giants. Both McGwire and Bonds were later
            found out to be users of performance enhancing drugs. As of this page's development, neither have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Contemporary Era</h2>
            <p>In <span class="Years" data="2007">2007</span>, a former senator and diplomat, George Mitchell,
            released an MLB-commissioned report detailing MLB's ties to performance enhancing drugs. The
            report linked 89 names to performance enhancing drugs and the fallout included a large number of
            suspensions and a crackdown on the use of performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
            <p><span class="btn Homeruns">Homeruns</span> per game had already begun to decline before the release of the Mitchell Report,
            but began declining more dramatically after its release. <span class="btn RunsPerGame">Runs Per Game</span> began to decline significantly as well. </p>
            <p>One should notice that something significant happened in <span class="Years" data="2015">2015</span>. Homerun numbers surged, out of nowhere,
            to rates not seen since the Steriod Era. In <span class="Years" data="2016">2016</span>, homerun rates increased even more to the highest level in the history of baseball. What changed? Pitchers
            theorized that the MLB started "juicing" the baseball midway through <span class="Years" data="2015">2015</span> in order to increase homeruns and excitement. Many pitchers also claimed to
            be able to detect a difference in the feel of the ball. The MLB fervently denied this until <span class="Years" data="2018">2018</span>, when MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that
            something had changed in the composition of the balls, although not under the intention of the MLB. Nonetheless, the baseballs became more aerodynamic and homerun production soared.</p>
            <p>A related factor in increasing homeruns is a phenomenon called The Launch Angle Revolution. This involves
            hitters intentionally trying to hit the ball in the air, rather than on the ground, in order to hit more doubles and homeruns.</p>
            <p>We also see <span class="btn Strikeouts">Strikeouts</span> per game increase sharply and steadily in the contemporary era,
            due in part to the previously mentioned emphasis placed on hitting homeruns by
            more and more hitters. This increase is also partially explained by better pitchers throwing harder than they ever
            have in the past. The average fastball velocity was 93.1 MPH in <span class="Years" data="2017">2017</span>,
            compared to about 89 MPH in <span class="Years" data="2002">2002</span>. Players in general
            are better trained and more athletic than they have every been; It is an exciting time for baseball.</p>
